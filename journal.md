I dont think that the new implimented cell phone law is very effective in school. Ive seen plenty of times that many students never use there phone in class when the law wasnt implmented yet. Phones arent to blame for if students are doing bad in class because they should already have the responsibility to know to do thier assignments and have good grades. Although the benefits of this law is that students are more engaged in class since they dont have a distraction or the urge to use there phone if the device will be taken away. there is no change for myself since im already engaged and passing all my classes but i do hope that students just focus on thier classes for thier own future and careers.
