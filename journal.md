I dont think that the new implimented cell phone law is very effective in school. Ive seen plenty of times that many students never use there phone in class when the law wasnt implmented yet. Phones arent to blame for if students are doing bad in class because they should already have the responsibility to know to do thier assignments and have good grades. Although the benefits of this law is that students are more engaged in class since they dont have a distraction or the urge to use there phone if the device will be taken away. there is no change for myself since im already engaged and passing all my classes but i do hope that students just focus on thier classes for thier own future and careers.

I am interested in becoming a artist someday and i believe that computer science can really help me with that. Computer science can be used in digital art wheteher its digital art and or traditional art on paper. Computer science can be used to make art models on a software or even models for game design for characters in a video game. It can be used to make visual effects, digital animation and or other media for film, video and web. There are many software for 2d art and every single one has different tools to make art maybe different brushes, inking or erasing tools but overall computer science can take a great part in the process of art

I really think that the use of Artificial intellegience can be used tro help people in everyday life. Ai can be used for things like education, becuase ai has the ability to solve equations and explain the problem solving step by step. including helping teachers grade school work and making sure whether or not the answers are correct. Ai is also used to generate images or content so it could also be used to generate ideas for film making under the supervision of humans. Including generating ideas for architecture and solving the equations of cost and ideas to cut the number of costs under the supervision of construction workers.
