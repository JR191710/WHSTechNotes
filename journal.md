I dont think that the new implimented cell phone law is very effective in school. Ive seen plenty of times that many students never use there phone in class when the law wasnt implmented yet. Phones arent to blame for if students are doing bad in class because they should already have the responsibility to know to do thier assignments and have good grades. Although the benefits of this law is that students are more engaged in class since they dont have a distraction or the urge to use there phone if the device will be taken away. there is no change for myself since im already engaged and passing all my classes but i do hope that students just focus on thier classes for thier own future and careers.

I am interested in becoming a artist someday and i believe that computer science can really help me with that. Computer science can be used in digital art wheteher its digital art and or traditional art on paper. Computer science can be used to make art models on a software or even models for game design for characters in a video game. It can be used to make visual effects, digital animation and or other media for film, video and web. There are many software for 2d art and every single one has different tools to make art maybe different brushes, inking or erasing tools but overall computer science can take a great part in the process of art

I really think that the use of Artificial intellegience can be used tro help people in everyday life. Ai can be used for things like education, becuase ai has the ability to solve equations and explain the problem solving step by step. including helping teachers grade school work and making sure whether or not the answers are correct. Ai is also used to generate images or content so it could also be used to generate ideas for film making under the supervision of humans. Including generating ideas for architecture and solving the equations of cost and ideas to cut the number of costs under the supervision of construction workers.

I think that working in a virtual store is a bad idea for both the brand responsible for making the game and the player playing the game. The brand can gain recognition for the game whether good or bad and they can recieve a reputaion depending on the response for the quality of thier game. At the same time the brand responsible for making the game are actively losing money while people are taking up thier virtual job. The person playing the game cannot gain any experience of having an actual job, and working in a virtual store for 16.10 and hour is not a sustanable job. The player is gaining money from voluntering but is actively sacrificing time in exchange making it bad.

Today using Canva AI i generated a interactive slide deck that teaches and explains step by step to students how use basic Math formulas step by step. My specific prompt for this slide was "Generate a interactive slideshow that teaches and explains how to solve for area step by step." When I created it, it went better than I expected, it went in depth on how to solve for area. The only part that didnt come as expected was that it went above and beyond by including formulas meant for different shapes like triangles, sqaures and circles without messing up the slides.
I could now see how prompt engineering can be very valuable in the future for careers by providing creativity in projects, slide shows or even ideas for software development, since it can generate things like images, slide show presentations and even code but it varies depending on what you use.

SNAP is a program that was made to help millions of people buy food and grocieries each month,but recently over the weekend it has unfortunely lost its all funding. Now becuase of this people associaed with the program are not guaranteed to recieve benefits. Now certain people have to meet the right standards to recieve those said benefits like coming from a low income home and the people who are gettng these benefits are now children, the elderly, and people with disaabilities. One way SNAP can solve this problem is through the use of technology, With technology it can help people in many ways such as online shopping to search for certain grocieries on low prices. Another way is using software such as google maps, This way people in need of food can look up locations of nearby food banks so that they may spend less money on food.
